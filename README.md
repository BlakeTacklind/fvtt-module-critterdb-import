# fvtt-module-critterdb-import
Foundry VTT module to import bestiaries from CritterDB

This module is currently a work in progress and is not fully functional.
It will currently import major stats and some other flavor (size, type, etc), but does not handle attacks, actions, and spells.

## To use:
1. Copy some CritterDB JSON to the clipboard using the export functionality provided there
2. Go to the "Compendiums" tab in the Foundry sidebar and click the "CritterDB Import" button
3. Paste in your CritterDB JSON
4. Select if you would like to update existing creatures
5. Click "Import"
